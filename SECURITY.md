# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure! We take the security of our project seriously and appreciate your contributions to our security efforts.

To report a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a GitHub issue, as it might expose the vulnerability to the public. Instead, we request you to report any security vulnerabilities through our dedicated HackerOne program.

**[Submit a Vulnerability Report to Bug Bounty Program](https://enj.in/security)**

Our security team will review your submission and follow up with any questions or updates. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues.

### Scope
